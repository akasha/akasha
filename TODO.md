# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Add force option to fetch

* Add boolean to source config to indicate whether it has been verified

* Add quiet mode to fetch so that only actions that require download print

* Add quiet mode to verify so that only messages occur on failures
