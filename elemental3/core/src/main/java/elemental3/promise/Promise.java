/**
 * The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
 *
 * <p>A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to
 * associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets
 * asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final
 * value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.</p>
 *
 * <p>A Promise is in one of these states:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>pending</code>: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
 * <li><code>fulfilled</code>: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</li>
 * <li><code>rejected</code>: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error). When either
 * of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called. If the
 * promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will
 * be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being
 * attached.</p>
