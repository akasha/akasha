    "description": "Symbol is a built-in object whose constructor returns a symbol primitive &mdash; also called a Symbol value or just a Symbol &mdash; that&rsquo;s guaranteed to be unique. Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that won&rsquo;t collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object. That enables a form of weak encapsulation, or a weak form of information hiding.",
