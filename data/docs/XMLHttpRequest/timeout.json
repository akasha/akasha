    "description": "The XMLHttpRequest.timeout property is an unsigned long representing the number of milliseconds a request can take before automatically being terminated. The default value is 0, which means there is no timeout. Timeout shouldn't be used for synchronous XMLHttpRequests requests used in a document environment or it will throw an InvalidAccessError exception. When a timeout happens, a timeout event is fired."
