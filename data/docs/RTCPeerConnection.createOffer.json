    "description": "<p>The <strong><code>createOffer()</code></strong> method of the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> interface initiates the creation of an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP\">SDP</a> offer for the purpose of starting a new WebRTC connection to a remote peer. The SDP offer includes information about any <code>MediaStreamTrack</code>s already attached to the WebRTC session, codec, and options supported by the browser, and any candidates already gathered by the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE\">ICE</a> agent, for the purpose of being sent over the signaling channel to a potential peer to request a connection or to update the configuration of an existing connection.</p>\n<p>The return value is a <code>Promise</code> which, when the offer has been created, is resolved with a <code>RTCSessionDescription</code> object containing the newly-created offer.</p>"
