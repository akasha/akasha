    "description": "document.load() is a part of an old version of the W3C DOM Level 3 Load &amp; Save module. Can be used with document.async to indicate whether the request is synchronous or asynchronous (the default). As of at least Gecko 1.9, this no longer supports cross-site loading of documents (Use XMLHttpRequest or fetch() instead)."
