This lets you change the ICE servers used by the connection and which transport policies to use.</p>\n<p>The most common use case for this method (and even then, probably not a very common use case) is to replace the set of ICE servers to be used. Two potential scenarios in which this might be done:</p>\n<ul> \n <li>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> was instantiated without specifying any ICE servers. If, for example, the <code>RTCPeerConnection()</code> constructor was called with no parameters, you would have to then call <code>setConfiguration()</code> to add ICE servers before ICE negotiation could begin.</li> \n <li>Renegotiation of the connection is needed, and a different set of ICE servers needs to be used for some reason. Perhaps the user has moved into a new region, so using new regional ICE servers is necessary, for example. In this situation, one might call <code>setConfiguration()</code> to switch to new regional ICE servers, then initiate an ICE restart.</li> \n</ul>\n<div class=\"note\"> \n <p>You cannot change the identity information for a connection once it's already been set.</p> \n</div>"
