    "description": "The WebGLRenderingContext.uniform[1234][fi][v]() methods of the WebGL API specify values of uniform variables. All active uniform variables defined in a program object are initialized to 0 when the program object is linked successfully. They retain the values assigned to them by a call to this method until the next successful link operation occurs on the program object, when they are once again initialized to 0."
