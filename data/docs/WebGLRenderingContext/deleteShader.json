    "description": "The WebGLRenderingContext.deleteShader() method of the WebGL API marks a given WebGLShader object for deletion. It will then be deleted whenever the shader is no longer in use. This method has no effect if the shader has already been deleted, and the WebGLShader is automatically marked for deletion when it is destroyed by the garbage collector."
