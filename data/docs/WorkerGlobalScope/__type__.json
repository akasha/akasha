    "description": "The WorkerGlobalScope interface of the Web Workers API is an interface representing the scope of any worker. Workers have no browsing context; this scope contains the information usually conveyed by Window objects â€” in this case event handlers, the console or the associated WorkerNavigator object. Each WorkerGlobalScope has its own event loop."
