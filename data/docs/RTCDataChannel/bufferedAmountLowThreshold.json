This event may be used, for example, to implement code which queues more messages to be sent whenever there's room to buffer them. Listeners may be added with <code>onbufferedamountlow</code> or <code>addEventListener()</code>.</p>\n<p>The user agent may implement the process of actually sending data in any way it chooses; this may be done periodically during the event loop or truly asynchronously. As messages are actually sent, this value is reduced accordingly.</p>\n<div class=\"note\"> \n <p><code>bufferedamountlow </code>events are not fired after the data channel is closed.</p> \n</div>"
