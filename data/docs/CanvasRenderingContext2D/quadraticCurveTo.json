    "description": "The CanvasRenderingContext2D.quadraticCurveTo() method of the Canvas 2D API adds a quadratic B&eacute;zier curve to the current sub-path. It requires two points: the first one is a control point and the second one is the end point. The starting point is the latest point in the current path, which can be changed using moveTo() before creating the quadratic B&eacute;zier curve."
