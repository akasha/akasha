    "description": "The non-standard and internal only CanvasRenderingContext2D.drawWidgetAsOnScreen() method of the Canvas 2D API renders the root widget of a window into the canvas. Unlike drawWindow(), this API uses the operating system to snapshot the widget on-screen, rather than reading from Gecko's own compositor."
