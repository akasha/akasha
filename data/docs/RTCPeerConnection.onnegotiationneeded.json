    "description": "The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> interface's <strong><code>onnegotiationneeded</code></strong> property is an <code>EventListener</code> which specifies a function which is called to handle the <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\">negotiationneeded</a></code> event when it occurs on an <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> instance. This event is fired when a change has occurred which requires session negotiation. This negotiation should be carried out as the offerer, because some session changes cannot be negotiated as the answerer.\n<p>Most commonly, the <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\">negotiationneeded</a></code> event is fired after a send track is added to the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. If the session is modified in a manner that requires negotiation while a negotiation is already in progress, no <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\">negotiationneeded</a></code> event will fire until negotiation completes, and only then if negotiation is still needed.</p>"
