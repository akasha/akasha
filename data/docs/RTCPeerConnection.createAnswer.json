    "description": "The <strong><code>createAnswer()</code></strong> method on the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> interface creates an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SDP\">SDP</a> answer to an offer received from a remote peer during the offer/answer negotiation of a WebRTC connection. The answer contains information about any media already attached to the session, codecs and options supported by the browser, and any <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE\">ICE</a> candidates already gathered. The answer is delivered to the returned <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"><code>Promise</code></a>, and should then be sent to the source of the offer to continue the negotiation process."
