    "description": "The Uint16Array typed array represents an array of 16-bit unsigned integers in the platform byte order. If control over byte order is needed, use DataView instead. The contents are initialized to 0. Once established, you can reference elements in the array using the object's methods, or using standard array index syntax (that is, using bracket notation)."
