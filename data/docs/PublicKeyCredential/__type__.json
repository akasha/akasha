    "description": "The PublicKeyCredential interface provides information about a public key / private key pair, which is aÂ credential for logging in to a service using an un-phishable and data-breach resistant asymmetric key pair instead of a password. It inherits from Credential, and was created by the Web Authentication API extension to the Credential Management API. Other interfaces that inherit from Credential are PasswordCredential and FederatedCredential."
