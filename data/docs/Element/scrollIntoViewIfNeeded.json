    "description": "The Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded() method scrolls the current element into the visible area of the browser window if it's not already within the visible area of the browser window. If the element is already within the visible area of the browser window, then no scrolling takes place. This method is a proprietary variation of the standard Element.scrollIntoView() method."
