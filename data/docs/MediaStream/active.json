    "description": "The active read-only property of the MediaStream interface returns a Boolean value which is true if the stream is currently active; otherwise, it returns false. A stream is considered active if at least one of its MediaStreamTracks is not in the MediaStreamTrack.ended state. Once every track has ended, the stream's active property becomes false."
