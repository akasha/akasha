    "description": "The IntersectionObserverEntry interface's read-only isIntersecting property is a Boolean value which is true if the target element intersects with the intersection observer's root. If this is true, then, the IntersectionObserverEntry describes a transition into a state of intersection; if it's false, then you know the transition is from intersecting to not-intersecting."
