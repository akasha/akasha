    "description": "The unwrapKey() method of the SubtleCrypto interface \"unwraps\" a key. This means that it takes as its input a key that has been exported and then encrypted (also called \"wrapped\"). It decrypts the key and then imports it, returning a CryptoKey object that can be used in the Web Crypto API."
