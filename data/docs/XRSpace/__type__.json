    "description": "The XRSpace interface of the WebXR Device API is an abstract interface providing a common basis for every class which represents a virtual coordinate system within the virtual world, in which its origin corresponds to a physical location. Spatial data in WebXR is always expressed relative to an object based upon one of the descendant interfaces of XRSpace, at the time at which a given XRFrame takes place.The XRSpace interface of the WebXR Device API is an abstract interface providing a common basis for every class which represents a virtual coordinate system within the virtual world, in which its origin corresponds to a physical location.Numeric values such as pose positions are thus coordinates in the corresponding XRSpace, relative to that space's origin.",
