Spatial data in WebXR is always expressed relative to an object based upon one of the descendant interfaces of <code>XRSpace</code>, at the time at which a given <code>XRFrame</code> takes place.</p>\n<p class=\"summary\">Numeric values such as pose positions are thus coordinates in the corresponding <code>XRSpace</code>, relative to that space's origin.</p>\n<div class=\"blockIndicator note\"> \n <p class=\"summary\"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>XRSpace</code> interface is never used directly; instead, all spaces are created using one of the interfaces based on <code>XRSpace</code>. At this time, those are <code>XRReferenceSpace</code> and <code>XRBoundedReferenceSpace</code>.</p> \n</div>"
