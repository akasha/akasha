    "description": "The MediaStream is created when the node is created and is accessible via the MediaStreamAudioDestinationNode's stream attribute. This stream can be used in a similar way as a MediaStream obtained via navigator.getUserMedia â€” it can, for example, be sent to a remote peer using the RTCPeerConnection addStream() method."
