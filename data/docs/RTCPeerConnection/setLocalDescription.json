    "content": "The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> method <code>setLocalDescription()</code> changes the local description associated with the connection. This description specifies the properties of the local end of the connection, including the media format. The method takes a single parameter—the session description—and it returns a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"><code>Promise</code></a> which is fulfilled once the description has been changed, asynchronously.\n<p>If <code>setLocalDescription()</code> is called while a connection is already in place, it means renegotiation is underway (possibly to adapt to changing network conditions). Because descriptions will be exchanged until the two peers agree on a configuration, the description submitted by calling <code>setLocalDescription()</code> does not immediately take effect. Instead, the current connection configuration remains in place until negotiation is complete. Only then does the agreed-upon configuration take effect.</p>"
