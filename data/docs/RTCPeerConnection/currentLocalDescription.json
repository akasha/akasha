    "content": "The read-only property <code><strong>RTCPeerConnection.currentLocalDescription</strong></code> returns an <code>RTCSessionDescription</code> object describing the local end of the connection as it was most recently successfully negotiated since the last time the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> finished negotiating and connecting to a remote peer. Also included is a list of any ICE candidates that may already have been generated by the ICE agent since the offer or answer represented by the description was first instantiated.\n<p>To change the <code>currentLocalDescription</code>, call <code>RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription()</code>, which triggers a series of events which leads to this value being set. For details on what exactly happens and why the change isn't necessarily instantaneous, see Pending and current descriptions in WebRTC connectivity.</p>\n<div class=\"note\"> \n <p>Unlike <code>RTCPeerConnection.localDescription</code>, this value represents the actual current state of the local end of the connection; <code>localDescription</code> may specify a description which the connection is currently in the process of switching over to.</p> \n</div>"
