    "description": "The RTCPeerConnection interface's onnegotiationneeded property is an EventListener which specifies a function which is called to handle the negotiationneeded event when it occurs on an RTCPeerConnection instance. This event is fired when a change has occurred which requires session negotiation. This negotiation should be carried out as the offerer, because some session changes cannot be negotiated as the answerer."
