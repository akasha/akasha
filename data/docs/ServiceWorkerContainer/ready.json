    "description": "The ready read-only property of the ServiceWorkerContainer interface provides a way of delaying code execution until a service worker is active. It returns a Promise that will never reject, and which waits indefinitely until the ServiceWorkerRegistration associated with the current page has an active worker. Once that condition is met, it resolves with the ServiceWorkerRegistration."
