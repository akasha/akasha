Each point is treated as a two-dimensional point, and must be located at ground level (that is, its<code>y</code>coordinate must be 0).</p>\n<p>This boundary is typically configured by the user, using the software that controls their XR hardware. This may be done by walking the border of the space they wish to use, or by drawing the shape of their room using their XR input device. Theoretically, a more advanced system might use sensors or other detection methods to determine the bounds of a dedicated XR room (notice how we carefully don't call it a holodeck?).</p>"
