    "description": "The TextEncoder.prototype.encodeInto() method takes a USVString to encode and a destination Uint8Array to put resulting UTF-8 encoded text into, and returns a dictionary object indicating the progress of the encoding. This is potentially more performant than the older encode() method especially when the target buffer is a view into a Wasm heap."
