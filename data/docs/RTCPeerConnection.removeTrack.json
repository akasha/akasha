    "description": "<p>The <code><strong>RTCPeerConnection.removeTrack()</strong></code> method tells the local end of the connection to stop sending media from the specified track, without actually removing the corresponding <code>RTCRtpSender</code> from the list of senders as reported by <code>RTCPeerConnection.getSenders()</code>. If the track is already stopped, or is not in the connection's senders list, this method has no effect.</p>\n<p>If the connection has already been negotiated (<code>signalingState</code> is set to <code>\"stable\"</code>), it is marked as needing to be negotiated again; the remote peer won't experience the change until this negotiation occurs. A <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/negotiationneeded\">negotiationneeded</a></code> event is sent to the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> to let the local end know this negotiation must occur.</p>"
