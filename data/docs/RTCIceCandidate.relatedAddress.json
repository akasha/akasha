    "description": "<p>The <strong><code>RTCIceCandidate</code></strong> interface's read-only <strong><code>relatedAddress</code></strong> property is a string indicating the <strong>related address</strong> of a relay or reflexive candidate. If the candidate is a host candidate (that is, its <code>ip</code> is in fact the real IP address of the remote peer), <code>relatedAddress</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>relatedAddress</code> field's value is set when the <code>RTCIceCandidate()</code> constructor is used. You can't specify the value of <code>relatedAddress</code> in the options object, but the address is automatically extracted from the <code>candidate</code> a-line, if it's formatted properly, being taken from its <code>rel-address</code> field.</p>\n<p>The related address and port (<code>relatedPort</code>) are not used at all by <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ICE\">ICE</a> itself; they are provided for analysis and diagnostic purposes only, and their inclusion may be blocked by security systems, so do not rely on them having non-<code>null</code> values.</p>"
