    "description": "The KeyboardEvent.initKeyboardEvent() method initializes the attributes of a keyboard event object. This method was introduced in draft of DOM Level 3 Events, but deprecated in newer draft. Gecko won't support this feature since implementing this method as experimental broke existing web apps (see bug 999645). Web applications should use constructor instead of this if it's available."
