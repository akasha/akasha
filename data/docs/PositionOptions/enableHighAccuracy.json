    "description": "The PositionOptions.enableHighAccuracy property is a Boolean that indicates the application would like to receive the best possible results. If true and if the device is able to provide a more accurate position, it will do so. Note that this can result in slower response times or increased power consumption (with a GPS chip on a mobile device for example). On the other hand, if false (the default value), the device can take the liberty to save resources by responding more quickly and/or using less power.",
