Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the <a href=\"#Browser_compatibility\">compatibility table</a> at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.</p>\n<p>The <code><strong>RTCPeerConnection.onaddstream</strong></code> event handler is a property containing the code to execute whenthe <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/addstream\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/addstream\">addstream</a></code> event, of type <code>MediaStreamEvent</code>, is received by this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. Such an event is sent when a <code>MediaStream</code> is added to this connection by the remote peer. The event is sent immediately after the call <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> and doesn't wait for the result of the SDP negotiation.</p>\n<div class=\"warning\"> \n <p><strong>Important:</strong> This property has been <strong>removed</strong> from the specification; you should now use <code>RTCPeerConnection.ontrack</code> to watch for <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/track\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/track\">track</a></code> events instead. It is included here in order to help you adapt existing code and understand existing samples, which may not be up-to-date yet.</p> \n</div>"
