Without the depth buffer, these computations must rely entirely on the coordinates of each pixel.</p>\n<p>This property differs from <code>depth</code> in that <code>depth</code> requests a WebGL layer that does not have a depth buffer at all, while <code>ignoreDepthValues</code> merely asks that the depth layer be ignored.</p>"
