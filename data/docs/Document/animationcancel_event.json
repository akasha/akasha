    "description": "The animationcancel event is fired when a CSS Animation unexpectedly aborts. In other words, any time it stops running without sending an animationend event. This might happen when the animation-name is changed such that the animation is removed, or when the animating node is hidden using CSS. Therefore, either directly or because any of its containing nodes are hidden.",
