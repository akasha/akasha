Try to avoid using it.</p>\n<p>The <code><strong>RTCPeerConnection.onidpassertionerror</strong></code> event handler is a property containing the code to execute whent the <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/idpassertionerror\" title=\"/en-US/docs/Web/Events/idpassertionerror\">idpassertionerror</a></code> event, of type <code>RTCIdentityErrorEvent</code>, is received by this <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. Such an event is sent when the associated identity provider (IdP) encounters an error while generating an identity assertion.</p>\n<p><em>This event handler is deprecated.</em> You should instead detect IdP assertion errors by handling rejection of the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/promise\"><code>promise</code></a> returned by <code>RTCPeerConnection.peerIdentity</code>.</p>"
