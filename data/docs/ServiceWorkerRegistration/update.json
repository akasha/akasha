    "description": "The update() method of the ServiceWorkerRegistration interface attempts to update theÂ service worker. It fetches the worker's script URL, and if the new worker is not byte-by-byte identical to the current worker, it installs the new worker. The fetch of the worker bypasses any browser caches if the previous fetch occurred over 24 hours ago."
